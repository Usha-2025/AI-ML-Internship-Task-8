# 🧩 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on their spending behavior and income.

The objective is to understand **unsupervised learning**, determine optimal clusters using the **Elbow Method**, and evaluate clustering using **Silhouette Score**.

This project is completed as part of **AI & ML Internship – Task 8**.
